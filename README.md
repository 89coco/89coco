### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I've taken part in Le Wagon London Web Development Bootcamp in 2022 - a thrill! âœ¨
Now I am keen to further hone the skills I have learnt in my free time ğŸ‘¯ as well as using them to help companies to digitize at speed and scale ğŸ‘€
I am also interested in how tech can be an enabler for sustainable development ğŸŒ± as well as mitigating potential adverse effects it may have or already has ğŸ”­
